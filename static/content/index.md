  description:
    - 'Introducing the IDC: Instant Dialogue Cleaner plug-in, the first real-time, cloudless solution by Audionamix. IDC offers immediate and effective dialogue cleaning technology through an intuitive interface and is compatible with many post-production and broadcast workflows. The software will be available for pre-launch sale starting on July 2nd.'
    - 'The IDC plug-in is versatile and easy to use due to its unique, integrated DNN artificial intelligence that automatically detects and separates speech, no matter the surrounding content. Specifically, the software excels at addressing common audio issues including complex interference, wind, birds or insects, car and plane interference and roomy recordings. With the turn of a knob, users can clean up dialogue from production audio, field recordings, news and sports recordings, and more, making it the perfect tool for audio post professionals, dialogue editors, re-recording mixers, and broadcast engineers.'
    - 'The plug-in supports sample rates between 44.1kHz to 192kHz, bit depths between 16 to 32-bits, and features fully automatable plug-in settings. During the pre-launch period, the perpetual license will be priced at $139, and will then increase to $199 after the pre-launch period ends.  Upon release, existing SVC owners will be eligible for a $50 upgrade to IDC.'
