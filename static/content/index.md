    - 'Introducing the IDC: Instant Dialogue Cleaner plug-in, the first real-time, cloudless solution by Audionamix. IDC offers immediate and effective dialogue cleaning technology through an intuitive interface and is compatible with many post-production and broadcast workflows.

Specifically, the software excels at addressing common audio issues including complex interference, wind, birds or insects, car and plane interference and roomy recordings. With the turn of a knob, users can clean up dialogue from production audio, field recordings, news and sports recordings, and more, making it the perfect tool for audio post professionals, dialogue editors, re-recording mixers, and broadcast engineers.'

  title: Intelligent Speech & Melody Extraction
  caption:  Unlike traditional denoisers that learn and remove noise, IDC works by separating and preserving speech by reducing background interference without compromising the integrity of the dialogue. IDC can succeed where other tools fail, such as with wind, roomtone and complex, varying background noise like birds, insects and extraneous car and plane sounds.
